# Small R Analytical Project

This repository contains an analytical project implemented in R, focusing on exploring the relationship between the average length of Internet use per day (expressed in minutes) and satisfaction with the current economic situation in Poland using linear regression.

## Introduction

The project aims to investigate whether there exists a correlation between two variables: the average length of daily Internet usage and the level of satisfaction with the current economic situation in Poland. This analysis employs linear regression techniques to model and understand the potential relationship between these variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains observations on the average daily Internet use in minutes and satisfaction scores with the economic situation in Poland. It comprises the following columns:

- `Internet_Usage`: Average length of Internet use per day (in minutes)
- `Economic_Satisfaction`: Satisfaction level with the current economic situation in Poland

The dataset used in this project is available [here](https://ess.sikt.no/en/datafile/d31bd02e-1d42-4046-96ec-da3fcadb1f2d/10?tab=documentation).

## Analysis

### Methodology

The project utilizes R programming language along with statistical libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. Specifically, it employs the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Reading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution and relationships between variables through visualizations and summary statistics.
3. Linear Regression: Building a linear regression model to investigate the relationship between Internet usage and economic satisfaction.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance and interpreting the results.

### Results

The analysis aims to determine:
- The strength and direction of the relationship between Internet usage and economic satisfaction.
- The predictive capability of the linear regression model.
- Any insights or implications drawn from the findings.
